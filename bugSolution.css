The corrected CSS code with the space added to the `calc()` function:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px); /* Added space around the - operator */
}
```

Adding the space around the minus operator fixes the issue.  This allows the browser to correctly parse and execute the calculation, resulting in the expected layout.
